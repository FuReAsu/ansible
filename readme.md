# Ansible Playbooks Collection

Ansible playbooks for multiple purposes. Mainly for learning, quick deployments or specialized setups. 

These are the playbooks I have worked on so far:

- [Kubernetes Node Setup for RedHat and Debian family nodes](k8s_node_setup)
- [DNS and NTP Setup for RedHat and Debian family nodes](dns_ntp_setup)
